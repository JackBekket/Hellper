Here is a markdown summary of the provided package code:

**embeddings**
================

### Overview

The `embeddings` package provides functionality for loading and interacting with vector stores, utilizing OpenAI's API and a PostgreSQL database.

### Configuration

* Environment Variables:
	+ `ai_url` (string)
	+ `api_token` (string)
	+ `db_link` (string)
* Flags/CommandLine Arguments:
	* None
* Files and their Paths:
	* None

### Launching the Application

The package can be launched in the following ways:

1. Run the `Rag` function with the required inputs (AI URL, API token, question, number of results, and a vector store).
2. Run the `SemanticSearch` function with the required inputs (search query, maximum number of results, and a vector store).

### Package Structure

```
lib/
embeddings/
common.go
load.go
query.go
```

### Code Summary

The package consists of three main files: `common.go`, `load.go`, and `query.go`.

* `common.go` is currently empty and does not perform any actions.
* `load.go` contains functions for loading documents into a vector store and retrieving text documents from a URL.
* `query.go` contains functions for running a retrieval QA from a language model using a question and vector store, and for performing a similarity search on a vector store.

### Relations between Code Entities

The code appears to be well-organized, with clear separation of concerns between the three main files. However, the `common.go` file is currently empty and does not seem to be utilized by the rest of the package.

### Edge Cases

* None found
