**database**
================

### Summary

The `database` package is a part of a larger project that appears to be related to natural language processing and AI-powered chat sessions. The package provides several data structures and functions to manage user data and AI sessions.

### Data Structures

* `User`: represents a user with various attributes (ID, username, dialog status, admin status, AI session, network, and topics)
* `SessionUsage`: represents a session usage with a map of usage data
* `AiSession`: represents an AI session with various attributes (GptKey, GptModel, AI type, dialog thread, and base URL)
* `ChatSessionGraph`: represents a chat session graph with a conversation buffer

### Functions

* `AddUser`: adds a user to the `UsersMap`
* `UpdateUserUsage`: updates the usage data for a user
* `UpdateSessionUsage`: updates the session usage data
* `GetSessionUsage`: retrieves the session usage data for a given ID
* `NewChatSessionGraph`: creates a new `ChatSessionGraph` instance

### Configuration

* Environment variables:
	+ `None`
* Command-line arguments:
	+ `None`
* Files and their paths:
	+ `None`

### Launching the Application

The application can be launched by running the `main` function in the `newUserDataBase.go` file.

### Edge Cases

* None found

**Notes**

The `User` struct is incomplete and is marked as a TODO, indicating that it should be fully functional and moved to a separate package.

=====================

### SetContext Function

The `SetContext` function sets the context for a `User` instance. It loads environment variables, retrieves a vector store using the `embeddings` package, and assigns it to the `VectorStore` field of the `User` instance. The function also closes the vector store using the `pgvector` package.

### ClearContext Function

The `ClearContext` function resets the `VectorStore` field of the `User` instance to `nil`.
