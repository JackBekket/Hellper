The package provides a set of functions to handle the interaction with a language model, such as OpenAI's GPT. It includes functions for initializing a new chat session, continuing a dialog, generating content, and handling various events during the interaction. The package also includes a handler that can be used to implement custom logic for different events, such as the start of a chain, the end of a chain, or the generation of content.

Environment variables:
- API_TOKEN: The API token for the language model.
- MODEL_NAME: The name of the language model to use.
- BASE_URL: The base URL for the language model API.

Flags:
- -api_token: The API token for the language model.
- -model_name: The name of the language model to use.
- -base_url: The base URL for the language model API.

Cmdline arguments:
- api_token: The API token for the language model.
- model_name: The name of the language model to use.
- base_url: The base URL for the language model API.

- lib/langchain/startDialogSequence.go

Edge cases:
- If the API token is not provided, the package will use a default token.
- If the model name is not provided, the package will use a default model.
- If the base URL is not provided, the package will use a default base URL.

## lib/langchain/handler.go

This file defines a handler for the language model interaction. It includes methods for handling various events, such as the start of a chain, the end of a chain, and the generation of content. The handler can be customized to implement specific logic for each event.

## lib/langchain/langchain.go

This file contains functions for initializing a new chat session, continuing a dialog, and generating content. It also includes functions for handling errors and updating the user's dialog status.

## lib/langchain/setupSequenceWithKey.go

This file defines a function to set up a sequence with a key. It takes a bot, user, language, context, and AI endpoint as input and returns a string, a chat session, and an error.

## lib/langchain/startDialogSequence.go

This file defines a function to start a dialog sequence. It takes a bot, chat ID, prompt, context, and AI endpoint as input and returns a string, a chat session, and an error.

The package provides a comprehensive set of functions for interacting with a language model, including handling events, initializing chat sessions, continuing dialogs, and generating content. It also includes a handler that can be customized to implement specific logic for different events.
