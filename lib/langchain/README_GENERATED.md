# langchain

This package provides a set of functions and structures for managing and interacting with a language model, specifically OpenAI's GPT-3. It includes functions for initializing new chat sessions, continuing existing conversations, and generating content from prompts. The package also includes a handler for logging response content choices, stop reasons, and other relevant information.

## Code Summary

### ChainCallbackHandler

This struct defines a set of callback functions that can be used to handle various events during the execution of a language model chain. The functions include HandleAgentAction, HandleAgentFinish, HandleChainEnd, HandleChainError, HandleChainStart, HandleLLMError, HandleLLMGenerateContentStart, HandleLLMStart, HandleRetrieverEnd, HandleRetrieverStart, HandleStreamingFunc, HandleToolEnd, HandleToolError, HandleToolStart, HandleText, and HandleLLMGenerateContentEnd.

### LogResponseContentChoice

This function logs the content, stop reason, context, generation info, prompt tokens, completion tokens, and total tokens of a response generated by a language model. It also updates the user's usage information and saves the updated usage to the database.

### InitializeNewChatWithContextNoLimit

This function creates a new chat session with the given parameters and returns the new chat session.

### StartNewChat

This function initializes a new chat session, runs a chain with the given prompt, and returns the result, session, and any errors encountered.

### RunChain

This function runs a chain with the given prompt and returns the result, session, and any errors encountered.

### ContinueChatWithContextNoLimit

This function runs a chain with the given prompt and returns the result, session, and any errors encountered.

### GenerateContentInstruction

This function generates content from a single prompt and returns the result and any errors encountered.

### SetupSequenceWithKey

This function acquires a lock on a mutex, retrieves the chat ID, GPT key, and GPT model from the user's AiSession, and calls the tryLanguage function to handle the language-specific logic. It then updates the user's DialogStatus and AiSession.DialogThread based on the language, retrieves the session usage, and updates the user's AiSession.Usage. Finally, it stores the updated user in the db.UsersMap.

### tryLanguage

This function initializes a language prompt based on the language code, retrieves the GPT key, GPT model, and chat ID from the user's AiSession, and calls the StartNewChat function to initiate a new chat session. It returns the chat result, thread, and any errors encountered.

### StartNewChat

This function is responsible for initiating a new chat session.

### errorMessage

This function logs an error, sends an error message to the user, instructs the user to recreate the client and initialize a new session, retrieves a random video file from the media directory, opens the video file, creates a new video message, sends the video message, and removes the user from the database.

### StartDialogSequence

This function locks a mutex, gets the user from the database, retrieves the GPT model and prompt, gets the dialog thread, continues the chat with the context and prompt, sends the AI response to the user, updates the user's dialog status, updates the user's session usage, gets the chat history, updates the user's dialog thread, updates the user in the database, and unlocks the mutex.
