# langchain
The langchain package is a Go-based project that provides a language model interface for generating content and handling conversations. The package consists of several files, including `handler.go`, `langchain.go`, `langgraph.go`, `setupSequenceWithKey.go`, and `startDialogSequence.go`.

## Environment Variables and Flags
The package uses the following environment variables:
* `api_token`: a string representing the API token
* `base_url`: a string representing the base URL
* `model_name`: a string representing the model name
* `ai_endpoint`: a string representing the URL of the AI endpoint
* `language`: a string representing the language

## Command Line Arguments
The package does not have any command line arguments.

## Files and Paths
The package consists of the following files and paths:
* `lib/langchain/handler.go`
* `lib/langchain/langchain.go`
* `lib/langchain/langgraph.go`
* `lib/langchain/setupSequenceWithKey.go`
* `lib/langchain/startDialogSequence.go`
* `../../media/` directory, which contains video files

## Edge Cases
The package can be launched in the following ways:
* By running the `StartDialogSequence` function in `startDialogSequence.go`
* By running the `RunNewAgent` function in `langgraph.go`
* By running the `GenerateContentInstruction` function in `langchain.go`

## Code Relations
The package has several code entities that are related to each other:
* The `ChainCallbackHandler` struct in `handler.go` implements the `callbacks.Handler` interface and has several methods that handle different events.
* The `LogResponseContentChoice` function in `handler.go` logs the content and other information from the `llms.ContentResponse` object.
* The `HandleLLMGenerateContentEnd` method in `handler.go` calls the `LogResponseContentChoice` function to log the response content.
* The `GenerateContentInstruction` function in `langchain.go` generates content based on a single prompt without memory and context.
* The `RunNewAgent` function in `langgraph.go` creates a new agent and runs a thread with the given user prompt.
* The `ContinueAgent` function in `langgraph.go` continues an existing agent and runs a thread with the given user prompt and conversation buffer.
* The `SetupSequenceWithKey` function in `setupSequenceWithKey.go` sets up a sequence with a key for a given user and language.
* The `StartDialogSequence` function in `startDialogSequence.go` starts a dialog sequence with the user.

## Unclear Places
There are a few unclear places in the code:
* The `RunNewAgent` function is not defined in the provided code, but it is called by the `tryLanguage` function in `setupSequenceWithKey.go`.
* The `ContinueAgent` function is not defined in the provided code, but it is called by the `StartDialogSequence` function in `startDialogSequence.go`.
