# langchain
The langchain package is a Go-based project that provides a language model interface for generating content and handling conversations. The package consists of several files, including `handler.go`, `langchain.go`, `langgraph.go`, `setupSequenceWithKey.go`, and `startDialogSequence.go`.

## Environment Variables and Flags
The package uses the following environment variables:
* `api_token`: a string representing the API token
* `base_url`: a string representing the base URL
* `model_name`: a string representing the model name
* `network`: a string representing the network to use (either "local" or "openai")
* `language`: a string representing the language to use

The package also uses the following flags:
* `ctx`: a context.Context object
* `bot`: a tgbotapi.BotAPI object
* `user`: a db.User object
* `ai_endpoint`: a string representing the AI endpoint

## Command-Line Arguments
The package can be launched with the following command-line arguments:
* `langchain -h` for help
* `langchain -v` for version
* `langchain -api_token <token>` to set the API token
* `langchain -base_url <url>` to set the base URL
* `langchain -model_name <name>` to set the model name
* `langchain -network <network>` to set the network
* `langchain -language <language>` to set the language

## Edge Cases
The package can be launched in the following edge cases:
* With a valid API token and base URL
* With a valid model name and network
* With a valid language and AI endpoint
* Without any of the above, in which case it will use default values

## Project Package Structure
The project package structure is as follows:
* `langchain/`
	+ `handler.go`
	+ `langchain.go`
	+ `langgraph.go`
	+ `setupSequenceWithKey.go`
	+ `startDialogSequence.go`
* `lib/`
	+ `langchain/`
		- `handler.go`
		- `langchain.go`
		- `langgraph.go`
		- `setupSequenceWithKey.go`
		- `startDialogSequence.go`

## Relations Between Code Entities
The code entities are related as follows:
* The `ChainCallbackHandler` struct in `handler.go` implements the `callbacks.Handler` interface and has several methods that handle different events.
* The `LogResponseContentChoice` function in `langchain.go` logs the content and other information from the `llms.ContentResponse` object.
* The `RunNewAgent` function in `langgraph.go` creates a new agent and runs a thread with the given user prompt.
* The `SetupSequenceWithKey` function in `setupSequenceWithKey.go` sets up a sequence with a key for a given user and language.
* The `StartDialogSequence` function in `startDialogSequence.go` starts a dialog sequence with a user.
