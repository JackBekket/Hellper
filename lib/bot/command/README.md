## Environment Variables, Flags, Cmdline Arguments, and Files
* Environment variables:
	+ `AI_ENDPOINT`
	+ `PG_LINK`
	+ `AI_BASEURL`
	+ `OPENAI_API_KEY`
	+ `IMAGE_GENERATION_MODEL`
	+ `IMAGE_GENERATION_SUFFIX`
* Files and their paths:
	+ `lib/bot/command/addNewUsertoMap.go`
	+ `lib/bot/command/cases.go`
	+ `lib/bot/command/commandHandler.go`
	+ `lib/bot/command/msgTemplates.go`
	+ `lib/bot/command/newCommander.go`
	+ `lib/bot/command/ui.go`
	+ `lib/bot/command/utils.go`

## Edge Cases for Launching the Application
The application can be launched using the following commands:
* `/image`: generates an image based on the provided prompt
* `/restart`: restarts the user session
* `/help`: sends a help message
* `/search_doc`: searches for documents based on the provided prompt
* `/instruct`: generates content using a local AI model
* `/usage`: sends usage information
* `/helper`: sends a media helper message
* `/setContext`: sets the user context
* `/clearContext`: clears the user context

## Project Package Structure
The project package structure is as follows:
* `lib/bot/command/`
	+ `addNewUsertoMap.go`
	+ `cases.go`
	+ `commandHandler.go`
	+ `msgTemplates.go`
	+ `newCommander.go`
	+ `ui.go`
	+ `utils.go`

## Relations between Code Entities
The code entities are related as follows:
* The `Commander` struct in `newCommander.go` has a field `bot` that is a pointer to a `tgbotapi.BotAPI` instance.
* The `HandleCommands` function in `commandHandler.go` uses the `Commander` struct to handle incoming Telegram bot messages.
* The `msgTemplates` map in `msgTemplates.go` is used to render message templates for the chatbot.
* The `RenderModelMenuLAI` function in `ui.go` renders a LLaMA-based model menu with an inline keyboard.

## Unclear Places or Dead Code
There are some commented out code blocks that may need to be revisited, such as:
* `// check for registration`
* `//	registred := IsAlreadyRegistred(session, chatID)`
* `/*
		if registred {
			c.usersDb[chatID] = db.User{updateMessage.Chat.ID, updateMessage.Chat.UserName, 1}
		}
	*/`
