**env**
================

**Summary:**
The `env` package is responsible for loading environment settings from a `.env` file and providing functions to access and manipulate these settings.

**Configuration:**

* `.env` file (used to load environment settings)

**Usage:**

The package can be used to load environment settings and provide access to these settings through various functions.

**Launch Options:**

* The package can be launched by running the `Load` function, which reads the `.env` file and populates the `env` map.
* Alternatively, the `LoadAdminData` function can be used to load admin data from the `env` map.
* The `LoadTGToken`, `LoadLocalPD`, `LoadLocalAI_Endpoint`, and `GetAdminToken` functions can be used to retrieve specific environment variables.

**Edge Cases:**

* If the `.env` file is missing or corrupted, the `Load` function will return an error.
* If an environment variable is not set, the corresponding function will return an error.

**Notes:**

* The package does not have any TODO comments, indicating that there are no outstanding tasks or issues.
* The code structure appears to be well-organized, with clear separation of concerns between functions.
