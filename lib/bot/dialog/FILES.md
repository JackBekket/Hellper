### External Data, Input Sources:  
  
1. `os.Getenv("AI_ENDPOINT")`: This variable holds the endpoint for the AI model, which is used for image generation and other AI-related tasks.  
2. `os.Getenv("AI_ENDPOINT")`: This variable holds the endpoint for the AI model, which is used for image generation and other AI-related tasks.  
3. `database.UsersMap`: This is a map that stores user data, including their AI session information and other relevant details.  
  
### Code Summary:  
  
#### Function: HandleUpdates  
  
This function handles incoming updates from the Telegram bot API. It iterates through the updates and processes each one based on its type.  
  
1. It first checks if the update is a callback query. If it is, it handles the callback logic for inline buttons and other interactive elements.  
  
2. If the update is not a callback query, it checks if the message is from a group chat. If it is, it skips the message if it doesn't contain the bot's username or if it's a voice or photo message.  
  
3. It then extracts the chat ID and user data from the database. If the user doesn't exist in the database, it adds them to the map.  
  
4. Based on the command in the message, it performs the corresponding action. For example, if the command is "/image", it generates an image using the AI model and sends it back to the user.  
  
5. It also handles other commands like "/restart", "/help", "/search_doc", "/rag", "/instruct", "/usage", "/helper", "/setContext", and "/clearContext".  
  
6. Finally, it updates the user's dialog status based on the current state of the conversation.  
  
#### Other Code Parts:  
  
1. The code also includes functions for handling model selection, connecting to the AI model, and generating content using the chosen model.  
  
2. It also has functions for handling user input, such as getting the API key, choosing a model, and providing feedback on the AI's response.  
  
3. The code is well-structured and modular, making it easy to understand and maintain.
