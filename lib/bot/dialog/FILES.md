### Summary:  
The `HandleUpdates` function is responsible for handling incoming updates from the Telegram bot API and managing user interactions. It iterates through the updates and processes each message based on the command provided by the user.  
  
#### Command Handling:  
- `/image`: Generates an image based on the provided prompt or a default prompt if none is given.  
- `/restart`: Restarts the user's session by deleting their data from the database.  
- `/help`: Displays a help message with available commands.  
- `/search_doc`: Searches for documents based on the provided prompt and returns the top 3 results.  
- `/rag`: Performs a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) task based on the provided prompt.  
- `/instruct`: Calls a local AI model to generate content based on the provided prompt and user's AI session settings.  
- `/usage`: Displays the user's current usage statistics.  
- `/helper`: Sends a media helper message to the user.  
  
#### User Interaction:  
- The function checks if the user is already in the database and adds them if not.  
- It then determines the user's dialog status and handles the corresponding interaction based on the status.  
- The dialog status is updated as the user progresses through the interaction, and the function logs the user's status and other relevant information.  
  
#### Network and Model Selection:  
- The function allows the user to choose their preferred network and AI model.  
- It handles the selection process and updates the user's AI session settings accordingly.  
  
#### Connecting to AI:  
- The function connects the user to the chosen AI model using the provided API key and base URL.  
  
#### Dialog Sequence:  
- Once connected to the AI, the function initiates a dialog sequence with the user, allowing them to interact with the AI and receive responses.  
  
The `HandleUpdates` function provides a comprehensive framework for handling user interactions, managing dialog states, and connecting users to their chosen AI models. It ensures a smooth and efficient user experience by providing a clear and organized structure for handling various commands and user interactions.
