**agent_test**
================

### Overview

The `agent_test` package is a test suite for the agent's OneShotRun functionality. It simulates conversations with the agent to test its ability to answer questions and remember previous conversations.

### Configuration

* Environment variables:
	+ `EMBEDDINGS_DB_URL` (commented out)
* Flags:
	+ None
* Command-line arguments:
	+ None
* Files and paths:
	+ None

### Launching the Application

The `agent_test` package is a test suite and cannot be launched directly. It can be run using a testing framework.

### Edge Cases

* The package is designed to be run as a test suite, and it is not intended to be launched directly.
* The `createGenericLLM` function is used to create a generic LLM model, which is then used in the tests.

### Package Structure

### Relations between Code Entities

The `agent_test` package is a test suite that uses the `agent` package to run the OneShotRun function, which interacts with the OpenAI API. The tests also use the `llms` package to create message content and the `godotenv` package to load environment variables.

### Unclear Places and Dead Code

* The `github.com/tmc/langgraphgo/graph` import is commented out, indicating that it is not currently used.
* The `db_link` variable is commented out in the `createGenericLLM` function, suggesting that it may have been intended to be used but is no longer necessary.
