# agent_test Package
The `agent_test` package contains test functions for the agent's functionality, including one-shot search, memory recall, and conversation tests. The package imports various libraries, including `flag`, `fmt`, `log`, `os`, `testing`, and several external libraries.

## Environment Variables and Flags
The package uses the following environment variables:
* `AI_ENDPOINT`
* `ADNIN_KEY`
* `EMBEDDINGS_DB_URL` (not used in this code snippet)
The model name is set to `tiger-gemma-9b-v1-i1`, but it is noted that it should be settable.

## Project Package Structure
The project package structure is as follows:
* `agent` directory:
	+ `duck_search_agent.go`
	+ `semantic_search_agent.go`
	+ `semantic_search_test.go`
	+ `superagent.go`
* `lib/agent` directory:
	+ `semantic_search_test.go`

## Code Entities and Relations
The code entities include test functions, such as `Test_Search`, `TestMemory`, `TestLongConversation`, and `Test5Conversation`, which test the agent's functionality. The `createGenericLLM` function creates a new instance of the `openai.LLM` model. The `OneShotRun` function takes a query, a model, and an initial state as input and returns a result.

## Edge Cases and Launch Options
The application can be launched using the following command-line arguments:
* `go test` to run the test functions
The package can be used as a command-line interface (CLI) or as a library.

## Unclear Places and Dead Code
There are TODO comments noting that the model name should be settable and that the `ai_url` should be global. However, these do not appear to be unclear places or dead code, but rather areas for future improvement.
