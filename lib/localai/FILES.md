## localai package  
  
This package provides functions for interacting with various AI models, including chat models and image generation models. It also includes a function for transcribing audio using the Whisper model.  
  
### Imports  
  
The package imports the following packages:  
  
- bytes  
- encoding/json  
- fmt  
- io  
- io/ioutil  
- log  
- mime/multipart  
- net/http  
- os  
- path/filepath  
- strings  
  
### External data, input sources  
  
The package uses the following external data and input sources:  
  
- API keys: The package uses an API key from the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` for authentication with the OpenAI API.  
- File paths: The `TranscribeWhisper` function takes a file path as input for the audio file to be transcribed.  
  
### TODOs  
  
- Implement a function to handle authentication with the OpenAI API using an API key.  
- Implement a function to generate images using the Stable Diffusion model.  
- Implement a function to transcribe audio using the Whisper model.  
  
### Summary of code parts  
  
#### `ChatRequest`, `Message`, `ChatResponse`, `Choice`, `UsageStatistics`, `GenerationResponse`, `GenerationData`, `GenerationUsage`, `WrongPwdError`  
  
These are data structures used to represent the request and response data for interacting with the chat model and image generation models.  
  
#### `main` function  
  
This function demonstrates how to use the `GenerateCompletion` function to send a chat request to the OpenAI API and retrieve the response.  
  
#### `GenerateCompletion` function  
  
This function takes a prompt, model name, and API URL as input and returns a `ChatResponse` object containing the model's response. It creates a JSON request body, sends the request to the API, and parses the response.  
  
#### `GenerateCompletionWithPWD` function  
  
This function is similar to `GenerateCompletion` but also takes a secret password as input and checks if it matches the stored password. If the passwords match, it calls `GenerateCompletion` to send the request and return the response.  
  
#### `GenerateImageStableDiffusion` function  
  
This function takes a prompt, image size, API URL, and model name as input and returns the URL of the generated image. It creates a JSON request body, sends the request to the API, and parses the response to extract the image URL.  
  
#### `TranscribeWhisper` function  
  
This function takes an API URL, model name, and file path as input and returns the transcribed text. It reads the audio file, creates a multipart request body, sends the request to the API, and parses the response to extract the transcribed text.  
  
#### `cleanText` function  
  
This function takes a string as input and removes any occurrences of "[BLANK_AUDIO]" from the string.
