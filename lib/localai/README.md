# localai

## Summary for localai.go

This code package provides a way to interact with a local AI model, specifically for text generation and image generation using Stable Diffusion. It includes functions to generate text completions, generate images, and upload images to a remote service like Telegraph.

The package defines several data structures to represent the input and output of the AI model, such as ChatRequest, ChatResponse, and GenerationResponse. It also includes error handling for incorrect passwords and failed requests.

The main function in the package is GenerateCompletion, which takes a prompt, model name, and URL as input and returns a ChatResponse object containing the AI's response. The package also includes a function to generate images using Stable Diffusion, which takes a prompt and size as input and returns the URL of the generated image.

In addition to the core functionality, the package also includes a function to upload images to a remote service like Telegraph. This function takes the image URL as input and returns the link to the uploaded image.

Overall, this code package provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with a local AI model, including text generation, image generation, and image uploading. It is well-structured and includes error handling and additional features like password verification and image uploading.



## Summary for setupSequenceWithKey.go

This code package provides a function called `SetupSequenceWithKey` that sets up a sequence with a key for a given user, language, and context. It uses a mutex to ensure thread safety and retrieves the user's GPT key, network, and model from the user's session. The function then calls the `tryLanguage` function to determine the appropriate language for the user and sends a message to the user's chat ID using the provided Telegram bot API.

The `tryLanguage` function takes the user's language, language code, context, and AI endpoint as input and returns a string containing the response and an error if any. It uses a switch statement to determine the appropriate language prompt based on the language code and then calls the `GenerateCompletionWithPWD` function to generate a response using the provided AI endpoint, password, and user's GPT key. The function then logs the response and returns the answer.

In summary, this code package provides a way to set up a sequence with a key for a given user, language, and context, and it uses a mutex to ensure thread safety. It also includes a function to determine the appropriate language for the user and generate a response using the provided AI endpoint, password, and user's GPT key.



## Summary for startDialogSequence.go

This code package provides a set of functions for managing user interactions with an AI model, specifically focusing on handling errors and initiating dialog sequences. The package utilizes a database to store user information and their current dialog status.

The `errorMessage` function is responsible for handling errors that may occur during the process of creating a request. It logs the error, sends a message to the user informing them of the issue, and removes the user from the database.

The `StartDialogSequence` function initiates a dialog sequence by sending a prompt to the AI model and displaying the response to the user. It retrieves the user's current dialog status and AI session information from the database, and then sends the prompt to the AI model. The response is then logged and sent to the user.

The `LogResponse` function logs the full response object, including details such as the created timestamp, response ID, model used, and usage statistics.

In summary, this code package provides a framework for managing user interactions with an AI model, handling errors, and initiating dialog sequences. It utilizes a database to store user information and their current dialog status, and provides functions for logging and displaying responses from the AI model.
