### Code Summary  
  
#### getEnvsForImgRec()  
  
This function retrieves the necessary environment variables for image recognition. It returns the AI endpoint URL, the model to use, and the API key.  
  
#### RecognizeImage()  
  
This function handles image recognition for a given Telegram message. It first extracts the image URL from the message, then calls the imageRecognitionLAI() function to perform the actual recognition. Finally, it returns the recognition result.  
  
#### handleImageMessage()  
  
This function extracts the image URL from a Telegram message. It retrieves the file information from the message and constructs the image URL using the bot's token and the file path.  
  
#### imageRecognitionLAI()  
  
This function performs image recognition using the provided AI service. It constructs a JSON payload with the model, prompt, and image URL, then sends a POST request to the AI endpoint with the payload and the API key. It then extracts the recognition result from the response and returns it.  
  
#### getMessageContent()  
  
This function extracts the recognition result from the response from the AI service. It parses the JSON response and returns the content of the message.
