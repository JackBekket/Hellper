### Summary  
The `imageRecognition` package provides functionality for recognizing images using an external AI service. It utilizes the OpenAI API and the Telegram Bot API to handle image uploads and responses.  
  
The package starts by defining a function `getEnvsForImgRec` which retrieves the necessary environment variables for the image recognition process. These include the AI endpoint URL, the image recognition model, and the OpenAI API key.  
  
Next, the `RecognizeImage` function takes a Telegram bot instance and a message as input. It first extracts the image URL from the message using the `handleImageMessage` function. Then, it calls the `imageRecognitionLAI` function to perform the actual image recognition using the retrieved environment variables and the extracted image URL.  
  
The `handleImageMessage` function retrieves the image file from the Telegram message and constructs the image URL. The `imageRecognitionLAI` function constructs a JSON payload containing the image URL, prompt, and other necessary parameters. It then sends a POST request to the specified AI endpoint with the payload and the OpenAI API key as an authorization header. The response from the AI service is then parsed and returned as a string.  
  
Finally, the `getMessageContent` function parses the response from the AI service and extracts the relevant message content.  
  
In summary, the `imageRecognition` package provides a complete solution for recognizing images using an external AI service, integrating with the Telegram Bot API for image handling and communication.
