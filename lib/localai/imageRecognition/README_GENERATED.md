# imageRecognition
The provided code is for an image recognition package that uses the Telegram bot API and an external image recognition model. The package has several functions to handle image messages, recognize images, and retrieve environment variables.

Environment variables:
* `AI_ENDPOINT`
* `IMAGE_RECOGNITION_ENDPOINT`
* `IMAGE_RECOGNITION_MODEL`
* `OPENAI_API_KEY`

Flags, cmdline arguments: None

Files and their paths:
* `imageRecognition.go`
* `lib/localai/imageRecognition/imageRecognition.go`

Edge cases for launching the application:
* The application can be launched as a Telegram bot, handling image messages and recognizing images using the external model.

Project package structure:
* `imageRecognition`
	+ `imageRecognition.go`
* `lib`
	+ `localai`
		- `imageRecognition`
			- `imageRecognition.go`

The code entities are related as follows: the `handleImageMessage` function retrieves the image file URL from a Telegram message, which is then sent to the `imageRecognitionLAI` function to recognize the image. The `getEnvsForImgRec` function retrieves the environment variables for image recognition, and the `getMessageContent` function reads the response from the image recognition model.

The `RecognizeImage` function is the main function that recognizes an image sent as a Telegram message and returns a response from the image recognition model.
